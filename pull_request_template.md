## Guidelines
- It is mandatory to assign a reviewer to PR
- A Pull Request must always refer to single or related usecase. Non related usecases must not be a part of same Pull request
- If a Pull Request has mix of type of changes then the description section must point to relevent information for each type `Note : We must avoid merging multiple changes in a single PR`
  - Bug Fix : Point to all issue id's of the bugs fixed. One commit mapped to one bug id. Do not fix multiple bugs in a single commit
  - New Feature: Must point to a usecase or relevent documentation bug
  - Enhancement: Must point to a usecase or relevent documentation bug
  - Refactoring: The context of why the refactoring has been done.
